        <h2>About Sensei Rossy Harinth, Founder of JKS Karate International</h2>
        <p> 
            Sensei Rossy Harinth, founder of JKS Karate International, has a distinguished background as both a karate instructor and a professional engineer. He began his education at Jaffna Hindu Primary School and St. John Bosco School in Jaffna. For his intermediate studies, he attended St. John’s College, where he completed his O/L (Ordinary Level) exams, and he went on to complete his A/L (Advanced Level) studies at Jaffna Hindu College.
            <br><br>
            Sensei Harinth pursued higher education in engineering, obtaining a Bachelor of Engineering with honors from the University of Moratuwa. During his time there, he was an active member of the university’s karate team and participated in inter-university karate tournaments. Following his undergraduate degree, he moved to Australia, where he completed a Master of Engineering at Griffith University. He also competed on the Australian university karate team.
            <br><br>
            Achieving a 3rd DAN black belt, Sensei Harinth began coaching the karate team at the University of Jaffna’s Kilinochchi campus in 2017. Under his guidance, his students earned the university’s first-ever inter-university medals in karate. In 2018, he founded JKS Karate International in Jaffna and subsequently became the head coach at the University of Jaffna’s main branch.
            <br><br>
            While working as an engineer for the Ministry of Irrigation in Colombo, Sensei Harinth expanded JKS Karate by establishing a branch in Colombo. His first black belt student, Sensei Thesinthan, opened a branch in Mullaitivu. Under his leadership, JKS Karate achieved significant success in the Northern Province Karate Tournament in 2019, winning 84 medals and becoming the top medal-winning club in the province. Sensei Harinth’s students continued to excel at the national level, winning 11 medals in 2018 and 23 medals in 2019 in Shotokan competitions.
            <br><br>
            During the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022, Sensei Harinth adapted by conducting classes via Zoom to continue training his students remotely. In 2022, he introduced karate at Jaffna Hindu College, where his students went on to win the first-ever provincial medal for the school. Over 100 students trained under his guidance at Jaffna Hindu College.
            <br><br>
            In 2023, at provincial karate tournaments, Sensei Harinth’s students won an impressive 137 medals for JKS Karate. Seven members, including Sensei Harinth, participated in the National Karate Tournament. At the end of 2023, Sensei Harinth moved to Australia to advance his engineering career as a Geotechnical Instrumentation & Monitoring Engineer. He continued to compete in karate, joining the New South Wales state team, where he won 13 medals in a short period and participated in the National Karate Tournament in Australia in 2024.
